a project thats meant for sending files accross networks, not recommended to do ANYTHING outside of ur network with this project.

TESTED ON MACOS ONLY, MIGHT NOT WORK ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS.

inspired off the way on how the Nintendo Switch sends files to a users smartphone, but ImageShare doesnt require you to join a different network.
